# Airbnb-Analysis
## Project Summary â€“ Airbnb Hosting Analysis in New York City
### Objective:
To analyze Airbnb hosting data across the five boroughs of New York City and develop interactive Power BI dashboards to gain insights into property performance, pricing strategies, and potential revenue.

### Tools Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy), Power BI (Power Query Editor, DAX, Data Modeling)

### Project Workflow:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (Python):

Imported and explored the raw Airbnb dataset using pandas.

Handled missing values, removed duplicates, standardized formats, and filtered inconsistent entries.

Utilized NumPy for efficient numerical operations and to engineer new fields relevant to hosting metrics.

### Data Enhancement in Power BI:

Uploaded cleaned data into Power BI via Power Query Editor.

Created custom and conditional columns such as:

Price per Night

Estimated Revenue per Property

Transformed data types and ensured consistency for robust reporting.

### Dashboard Development:

#### Overview Report:

Visualized trends across boroughs, including total listings, average prices, and top revenue-generating areas.

Implemented bar charts, maps, and key performance indicators (KPIs) for high-level insights.

#### Property Performance Report:

Developed a slicer-enabled interactive report.

Allowed users to drill down into individual properties to view occupancy, price trends, and estimated revenue.

## Outcome:

Delivered two interactive Power BI dashboards enabling data-driven decision-making for Airbnb hosts and stakeholders.

Enhanced data usability through intuitive slicing, filtering, and calculated metrics.
